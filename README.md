# Dyson Vacuum Wand Holder
I created a solution in the form of a 3D-printable clamp/mount that easily mounts to a wall with two standard size screws. This repository contains the STL of the final version (V2.1), as well as some pictures on how to install it and the mechanical drawing. I designed this specifically for the Dyson V8 Animal, although it should work for any Dyson-compatible Wand. This work is released under the GNU GPL license.

## What you will need
* A copy of this repository
* Access to a 3D printer and its control software (slicer, etc.)
* Two screws compatible with the surface you plan to mount this clamp on
* A screwdriver, drill, pencil, and appropriate drill bit to mark and drill holes and attach screws

## Steps
1. Download this repository
2. 3D-print the STL file titled "Clamp V2.1.stl"
3. Cleanup the print (no supports are needed when printing)
4. Find where you would like to place the clamp (make sure that there is enough clearance for the vacuum Wand's length!)
5. Drill pilot holes (using the clamp as a template)
6. While holding the print against the wall, carefully screw in the screws, making sure not the overtighten them (and crack the plastic)
7. Insert the Dyson Vacuum Wand and enjoy!

## Conclusion
Over the course of several months on constand use, I have found that this clamp is sturdy and effective. It has yet to fail in any way! Hopefully it works just as well for you if you decide to replicate this project! Contact me if you find any faults in the design/instructions.
