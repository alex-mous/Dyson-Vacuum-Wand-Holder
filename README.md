# Dyson Vacuum Wand Holder
Have you ever found yourself leaning the Wand from a Dyson vacuum cleaner against a wall for lack of a better place to put it? If so, then this is the project for you!

## Introduction
To resolve this issue, I designed a 3D-printable clamp that easily mounts to a wall with two standard size screws. This repository contains the STL of the final version (V2.1), as well as some pictures on how to install it and the mechanical drawing. I designed this specifically for the Dyson V8 Animal, although it should work for any Dyson-compatible Wand. This work is released under the GNU GPL license.

## What you will need
* A copy of this repository
* Access to a 3D printer and its control software (slicer, etc.)
* Two screws compatible with the surface you plan to mount this clamp on
* A screwdriver, drill and appropriate drill bits to drill holes and attached screws

## Steps
1. Download this repository
2. 3D-print the STL file titled "Clamp V2.1.stl"
3. Cleanup the print (no supports are needed when printing)
4. Find where you would like to place the clamp (make sure that there is enough clearance for the vacuum Wand's length!)
5. Drill pilot holes (using the clamp as a template)
6. While holding the print against the wall, carefully screw in the screws, making sure not the overtighten them (and crack the plastic)
7. Insert the Dyson Vacuum Wand and enjoy!

## Conclusion
In my opinion, this clamp is very effective. I have been using it for several months now, and I have yet to have it fail. Hopefully it works just as well for you if you decide to install it! Please contact me if you find any faults in the design.
